              <p>
                <span>Wee Quests aims to let people discover Scotland through app-led scavenger hunts.</span> The app will list hunts that have been pre-designed by locals and can be purchased by users. Players will also be able to create their own
                scavenger hunts to share with friends.

                <span>Wee Quests is a solo project, designed for my UX Immersion Course with Careerfoundry.</span> My work has spanned both UX and UI design, ranging from user research, through to prototyping and testing to writing a design language.

              <h3>My Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                To be effective as a scavenger hunt app, Wee Quests would need to motivate people to make the move from simply viewing the app, to actually going outdoors and taking a scavenger hunt.

              <h3>My Design Process</h3>
              <p>
                <span>Wee Quests’ UI has been shaped by elements from across my UX design process.</span> Competitor research and user interviews laid the foundations for what I wanted to achieve. I then built up my design through an iterative
                process of
                prototyping and user testing. Finally, design psychology and peer review helped to refine the interface.

            <h2>Researching the Project</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>Competitor Research</h3>
              <p>
                <span>I began my research by carrying out an analysis of competitor apps.</span> I discovered that people loved the fact that scavenger hunts allowed them to explore their home cities in a new way. However, people needed motivation to
                make the move from simply viewing an app to actually going out and taking a scavenger hunt.
                <p>Meanwhile, there was a gap in the market for an app aimed solely at individuals rather than also at businesses looking for team-building
                activities.</p>
              </p>
            </div>

              <h3>Surveys and Interviews</h3>
              <p>
                <span>With the help of a survey, I was able to define my target audience as 25-40 year olds who enjoy travel and activities that take them off the beaten track.</span> I then conducted in-person interviews to find out more: what would
                motivate people to use an app that took them on scavenger hunt tours?

                <span>Using data gathered in my research, I went on to form persona and user flows representative of my target audience.</span> This allowed me to clearly define my users’ goals and provided a reference for prototyping that would
                ensure
                my design stayed on track to meet their specific needs.

              <h3>An Early Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                <span>My starting point for prototyping was that my target audience would be motivated by an app that was fun, friendly and easy to use.</span> Following user interviews, I knew my audience found maps highly useful and that they would
                also need an instant overview of the key practical details of each scavenger hunt.
              </p>
              <p>
                My challenge was to put these elements together in an interface that was as simple to use as possible. A pivotal moment was the suggestion to introduce a toggle that would allow users to switch between a map view and a list view.

            <div>
              <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
              <p>
                <span>After I had created a black and white clickable prototype, I conducted five in-person moderated usability tests.</span> This played an important role in determining whether any issues were present in my prototype as well as
                confirming positive design decisions on which I could further build. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Testing showed that ease of use was so far successful with participants completing all scenario tasks and overall satisfaction of the app scoring highly in metrics. Meanwhile, I was able to identify and rectify areas where
                participants
                felt lost or needed further reassurance in the app's processes.

              <p>
                Testing alerted me to two high severity issues in the checkout feature which I prioritised resolving before moving onto working on my colour prototype.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first was that participants needed more reassurance that their payment was processed successfully; the second was that I had designed interaction with the payment fields in a way that was intuitive to me but that was not intuitive
                to
                three of my five participants. The latter was a quick fix but an important lesson in the value of testing at an early stage.

              <p>
                <span>Each feature of my prototype went through several iterations before I arrived at my current design.</span> Designing the Create a Hunt feature was central to my design process in terms of developing Wee Quests' personality and
                tone
                of voice. It also presented a key challenge: achieving a balance between ensuring guidance was readily available while at the same time allowing users freedom to explore...
